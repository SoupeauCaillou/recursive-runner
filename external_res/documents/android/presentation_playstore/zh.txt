跑跑，跳跳，就得分！容易吧？
當然! ... 除了要躲一個會跑會跳的障礙物外 : 你！ （和你（和你（和你（還有...））））
快來體驗一個全新的跑跳遊戲!
習慣玩到被擊中為止?
每個游戲你會有90秒。
習慣控制一個主角? 我們給你十個 !
訣竅?
You control them one at a time, when done with one, it will be stuck in a loop scoring points for you.
The challenge is to score with your current herowhile avoiding your previous doppelgangers - if you hit one of them he will disappear forever.
Several achievements to earn and a leaderboard to climb!
There are no ads in the game, since we like you, and that you dont like ads that dont like you
We hope you like avoiding recursivly running into a phantom-mime.
