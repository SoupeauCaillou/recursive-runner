Run, jump and score points! Sound easy?
Sure, except there is a running and jumping obstacle to avoid: You! (and You (and You (and You (and...))))
Experience an all new kind of running game!
Used to play until being hit by an obstacle?
You’ll play for 90 seconds each game.
Used to control 1 running hero? We’ll give you 10 of them.
The trick?
You control them one at a time, and when you’re done with one, he will do the same run over and over and continue to score points for you.
The challenge is to score with your current hero while avoiding your previous ones - if you hit one of them he will disappear forever.
We hope you’ll enjoy Recursive Runner.
We plan to keep updating the game for a while, and are waiting for player feedback to help us improve it!
