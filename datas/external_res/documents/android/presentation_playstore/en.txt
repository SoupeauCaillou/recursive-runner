Run, jump and score points! Sound easy?
Sure, except there is a running and jumping obstacle to avoid: You! (and You (and You (and You (and...))))
Experience an all new kind of running game!
Used to play until being hit by an obstacle?
You’ll play for 90 seconds each game.
Used to control 1 running hero? We’ll give you 10 of them.
The trick?
You control them one at a time, when done with one, it will be stuck in a loop scoring points for you.
The challenge is to score with your current hero while avoiding your previous doppelgangers - if you hit one of them he will disappear forever.
Several achievements to earn and a leaderboard to climb!
There are no ads in the game, since we like you, and that you dont like ads that dont like you
We hope you like avoiding recursivly running into a phantom-mime.
